Takeaway Challenge
==================

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

Hints on functionality to implement:

* ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
* place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
* The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
* Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
* Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
* Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
* However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
